                <p><i>LOGAR</i> is a geographical index and map of places relevant to Andean studies. It
                    focuses initially on the towns established during the mass colonial resettlement
                    program known as the <i>Reducción General de Indios</i> (General Resettlement of
                    Indians) of the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo. The Reducción forcibly resettled
                    approximately 1.4 million native Andeans into over 1,000 reducción (literally,
                    “reduction”) towns. Reducciones were founded (at least nominally) during the
                    Visita General (Toledo’s tour of inspection and resettlement) between 1570 and
                    1575. The scope of <i>LOGAR</i> is initially limited to the area under most direct
                    jurisdictional control of Viceroy Toledo—specifically, the audiencias of Lima
                    and Charcas. Following its introduction, <i>LOGAR</i> will be continuously updated by
                    edited contributions by scholars of Andean history in various countries, who
                    have expressed interest in having a tool and repository such as <i>LOGAR</i>. </p>
                <p> As a reference work, <i>LOGAR</i> is organized by an alphabetical index of places and a
                    map of place locations. Users may browse both located and unlocated places. The
                    concept of <i>place</i> is thus central to its organization. Following the conventions
                    of the ancient Mediterranean world, <i>LOGAR</i> defines
                    places as “geographical and historical contexts for names and locations” [1, 2].
                    Places may refer to discrete, locatable features in the physical world, such as
                    a town or road. But they are not only such features. Places can be
                    jurisdictional entities without discrete spatial footprints, or any
                    geographical, spatial, or historical context that is imbued with human
                    experience. This place concept is attributed most proximately to the geographer
                    Yi Fu Tuan [3]. </p>
                <p> Thus, places are not (or at least not only) locations; places may in fact be
                    un-locatable. Very few maps survive from the sixteenth-century Andes, and places
                    are almost never precisely located in colonial archival textual sources. Places
                    are instead most often “located” by names (toponyms), which may or may not have
                    been coevally or subsequently mapped or survived to the present. In cases in
                    which a place is not yet or cannot be located in <i>LOGAR</i>, its entry is listed in
                    the alphabetic listing of places, with no corresponding location on the map.
                    Each place entry cross-references instances of its mention in textual sources.
                    As a practical matter, this concept enables inclusion of places that are not (at
                    least currently) locatable, or preferably not represented as discrete points or
                    features on a map. Therefore, many places catalogued in <i>LOGAR</i> are not currently
                    located, but they may be in the future, as knowledge expands and as scholars
                    contribute to <i>LOGAR</i>. </p>
                <p> Other place-names in archival texts do not refer to spatially bounded entities
                    but, instead, to micro-ethnic groups constituting administrative jurisdictions.
                    For instance, a <i>repartimiento</i> most often referred to an ethnically identified
                    population granted in <i>encomienda</i> (a trusteeship of indigenous labor) to a
                    Spanish <i>encomendero</i> (trustee). A repartimiento could comprise the population of
                    a single reducción town, several reducción towns, or parts of several reducción
                    towns; in such cases, families within the same reducción belonged to different
                    repartimientos. <i>LOGAR</i> takes the editorial position that such instances should be
                    located approximately (and indicating as such) when possible, with iterative
                    locational revisions as new information is contributed by the <i>LOGAR</i> community. </p>
                <p> <i>LOGAR</i> builds directly on the open source code base and architecture of the
                    <a href="http://syriaca.org/">Syriac Gazetteer</a>. <i>LOGAR</i> is extensible (spatially and temporally), and over the
                    long term, aims to serve as a more general repository and research tool of broad
                    utility to the scholarly community of the Andean region. </p>
